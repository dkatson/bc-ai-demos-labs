# Business Central AI Demos and Hands-ons

Earlier this year I delivered a series of workshops and demos about AI integration in Business Central. For that, I had to prepare a lot of hands-on instructions and demos. This repository contains all of that stuff.

In the `Hands-on Labs` folder, there are Word source documents and PDF files for hands-on exercises. I am not 100% sure they are still functional (for some of them I am pretty sure they are not), and that's because Azure AI (or Cortana Intelligence, or whatever else you want to call it) stuff constantly changes, so the management part, or the API part or any part for that matter might have changed. This stuff was created in February 2019, and at the time of publishing this repo (September 2019) quite some of this may have changed.

This is just a content dump to allow anyone to try to get some value from quite some effort I put into this back in February. I don't know how much value there is in here, but if there is, it's better that this stuff be available to the public, than for it to just sit in my Dropbox.
